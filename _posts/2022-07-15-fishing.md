### Coverage Area:

Oklahoma and Montana

### Objective

Produce a limited coverage map layer targeting anglers and collect user feedback before building out more coverage. This was a team project with [Lee France](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lee-france-81933020/) and the feedback survey was sent to all Gaia GPS iOS users who had activate nautical focused map layer in their account.

Multiple datasets were used to include fishing-themed POIs such as access points, license dealers, fish habitat areas, and etc. along with lakes, rivers, and bathymetry where available.
