As a GIS engineer, Iâ€™m interested in projects that inspire others to explore the outdoors and show how we can work together to conserve our favorite places.

Recent projects have focused on curating geospatial databases for dispersed camping areas, snowmobile trails and POIs, along with roads/motorized trails on public lands.

Outside of geospatial work, I co-founded an American Ninja Warrior style gym for kids in my local community and enjoy spending time outside with my kids while showing them what conservation looks like first hand based on my fisheries management work with the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation.
